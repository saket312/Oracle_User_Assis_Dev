#Simple Docker Application

This document outlines my experience creating a simple Docker application, including any troubleshooting and improvements I would make.


#Setting Up the Application

I first installed Docker on my machine and created a new directory for the application. In this directory, I created a Dockerfile with the necessary instructions for building the image. I then used the docker build command to build the image and docker run command to run the container.

Overall, the process of setting up the application was straightforward and the Docker documentation provided clear instructions on how to build and run a container.


#Troubleshooting

I encountered an error with the docker run command, I checked the container logs using docker logs to see if there is any error message. I did not find any error so then i used the docker ps -a command to check if the container was in an error state or not. Since nothing was out of order,I checked if the image existed locally using docker images command and it didn't so I pulled the image using docker pull command. That is how I troubleshooted the issue I encountered.


#Improvements

Another improvement would be to use a container orchestration tool, such as Kubernetes, to manage multiple containers and handle scaling and load balancing.


#Conclusion

Overall, the process of creating a simple Docker application was relatively easy and the Docker documentation provided clear and detailed instructions. The troubleshooting I encountered was minor and I was able to find solutions with the help of the documentation and forums. With some further improvements, this application could be made more efficient and scalable.

The Docker documentation indeed explains how to build and run Docker containers. It also covers advanced topics such as working with networks, volumes, and configuring the container's environment, although these topics were beyond the scope of the current project so I did not cover them extensively.
